    <h1>fl-vue</h1>
    <p class="lead">A simple collection of VueJS components and mixins that
    interacts and generate content based on a JSON API response.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>It exists...</h2>
      <p>...because I mostly develop backend Rest API's and from time to time
      also make the frontend. Without failure, then I often end up writing the
      exact same code as I've done multiple times before on different projects.</p>

      <p>There are plenty of frameworks out there, and this one is likely not
      better then any of them. Maybe even worse? But it's tailored towards a
      JSON API and is intended to quickly generate standard HTML output based on
      data from the API. A good first-quick-example of how and why, take a look
      at the <fl-link to="/components/fl-link">fl-link</fl-link> component.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>A demo...</h2>
      <p>...is found right here. The documentation is also a live example of
      fl-vue, all the docs are made solely out of Vue and fl-vue, there is also
      a demo of every component at the top of the page.</p>

      <h2>It's licensed...</h2>
      <p>...under MIT, have fun.</p>
